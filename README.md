Our own wedding website, built in NodeJS and Angular. The live version is available at https://ли.ею.

Nothing cutting edge, just a small family website.

## Displaying photo albums

Create photo albums by creating a `photos` folder under `public`. Simply drop images there to have them displayed on the media page on the site. Subfolders will be interpreted as albums with the folder name being used as an album name. The folder can be prefixed with a number followed by an underscore to allow ordering of the albums.
